This example shows how the SPITS programming model can be used to compute a multi-staged job.
The value of pi is computed twice using different number if iteractions and the error is compared.

main.cpp: application source code

build.sh: simple script to compile the spits-pi program. It generates:
 - bin/spits-pi-seria: a standalone (serial) version of the application.
 - bin/spits-pi-module: a module (dynamic object) to be executed by a SPITS runtime. You may use the PYPITS runtime to run the application.

run-module.sh: simple script to run the application module using the PYPITS runtime. It will create a "run" directory, in which all the log files generated by the runtime will be stored.
